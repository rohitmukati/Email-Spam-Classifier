# Email-Spam-Classifier
Email Spam Classifier
Project Overview
This project aims to build an email spam classifier. The system performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large dataset, identifies spam-related words using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), and ultimately determines whether an email is spam or not.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for modeling.
Spam Word Identification: Using NLTK to identify words that are likely indicators of spam.
Spam Classification Model: Building a model to classify emails as spam or not spam.
Web Application: Creating a user-friendly web interface using Flask to check the spam status of an email.
